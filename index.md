## About Me

I am a Ph.D. candidate in Economics at LMU Munich. My research spans economic growth, economic history, and innovation. 
In my dissertation, I research human capital and technological progress during Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution.

During the academic year 2021--2022, I am visiting Northwestern University (invited by Joel Mokyr). Previously, I have visited Brown University from January to May 2020 (invited by Oded Galor).

I am available for interviews during the virtual EEA meeting and the virtual ASSA/AEA meeting.

In my dissertation, I tackle the question "Why isn't the whole world developed?" from the perspective of Europe: How did Europe become developed in the first place? In the context of France in the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, I establish novel facts which inform leading growth theories and big debates in economic history.

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  

This paper provides the first empirical cross-country evidence on inventive activity during the Industrial Revolution.
Idiosyncrasies in the French historic patent law allow us to compare invention rates in Britain and France across sectors based on French patent data from 1791 to 1855.
Our key result is a robust, positive association of invention rates in Britain and France at the sectoral level. Furthermore, we provide the first quantitative evidence on technological leadership in invention at the sectoral level. 
The evidence informs a debate about whether the acceleration of technological progress during the Industrial Revolution mainly was a British or a European achievement, which has implications for theories of growth and innovation.

**Knowledge, Education, and Economic Growth: Evidence from the Enlightenment in France**
  <br>
  &ensp; with Uwe Sunde (LMU Munich). &ensp; *Draft forthcoming*

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  

  This paper advances and empirically establishes the hypothesis that economic growth depends on the interaction between two dimensions of productive knowledge: knowledge embodied in people (human capital) and codified knowledge (non-rival ideas). France in the Enlightenment provides a unique historical setting that allows disentangling variation in both dimensions of productive knowledge to identify their interaction. We collected novel data on the establishment and curriculum of all public secondary schools in France from 1500 to 1800. The empirical strategy exploits historically predetermined spatial variation in education and time variation of Enlightenment that made codified knowledge widely available. We provide four key results. First, we trace the geography of schools and a scientific curriculum to historical factors going back to the late-Roman period and religious competition during the sixteenth century. Second, we show that cities with scientific education exhibited a greater demand for codified knowledge during the Enlightenment, as measured by subscriptions to the newly available Encyclopedia. Third, we show that the availability of codified knowledge increased the demand for scientific education, as reflected in enrolment in scientific subjects at schools of the revolutionary period. Forth, we document that education was instrumental for adopting codified knowledge as proxied by subsequent economic growth and innovation patents. The evidence is consistent with the view that human capital acquired in schools provided students with a "scientific literacy" necessary to utilize the ideas which spread during the industrial Enlightenment.

**Napoleonâ€™s schools: Education and Invention during the Industrial Revolution in France**

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  
Was math and science education relevant for invention during the first Industrial Revolution? 
This paper uses a quasi-natural experiment in France to estimate the causal effect of higher secondary school education in math and science on invention between 1800 and 1850. 
In the French Revolution, all public secondary schools in France were closed down and their endowments expropriated.
During Napoleon's reign, schools and curriculum were re-instated but with a different geographic allocation.
On the regional level, I find a positive education--invention gradient. Regions with high-quality math and science education had substantially higher patenting than regions with little math and science, while regions without math and science had less patenting overall. 
On the town level, I can estimate the causal effect of gaining or losing math and science education by combining two elements: (i) Instrumenting education as of 1789 based on plausibly exogenous historical determinants and (ii) conditioning on the presence or absence of this education after Napoleon to control for the endogeneity of current education.
