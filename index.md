## About Me

I am a Ph.D. canditate in Economics at LMU Munich. My research spans economic growth, economic history, and innovation. 
In my dissertation, I investigate how human capital, idea growth, and idea diffusion interacted during Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution to originate Europe's richess.

During the academic year 2021--2022, I am visiting Northwestern University at the invitation of Joel Mokyr. Previously, I have visited Brown University January to May 2020 at the invitation of Oded Galor.

I am available for interviews during the virtual EEA meeting and the virtual ASSA/AEA meeting.

In my dissertation, I tackle the question "Why isn't the whole world developed?" from the perspective of Europe: How did Europe became developed in the first place? In context of France in the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, I establish novel facts which inform leading growth theories and big debates in economic history.

## Job Market Paper

**Invention and Imitation during the Industrial Revolution** [*draft forthcoming*]
  <br>
  &ensp;   with Carl Hallmann and Emre Enez Yavuz (Northwestern)


  &ensp; *Abstract:* This paper provides the first evidence on idea growth and international idea diffusion at the industry and technology level during the Industrial Revolution. Our empirical approach focuses on the perspective of one country to obtain quantitatively comparable measures of idea growth and incoming idea diffusion. Using patent data from France 1791 to 1855, we distinguish invention and imitation patents. In the particular historical context, imitation mostly reflects the diffusion of British ideas to France. Our main result is a large and highly significant positive correlation of idea growth and idea diffusion across industry and technology. We argue that the result informs a debate among two views of idea growth and international idea diffusion which have conflicting predictions on the sign of this correlation. The simultaneity view, on the one hand, predicts a positive correlation because of knowledge spillovers or because invention and imitation are complementary activities. The leader--follower view, on the other hand, predicts a negative correlation because of variation of advantages in invention across sectors, for example due to directed technical change. While the evidence on the correlation confirms the simultaneity view and rejects the leader--follower view, we show that the leader--follower view is nevertheless right about its additional prediction of specialization on invention or imitation across sectors. Based on the revealed relative technological lead of industries, we document a clear pattern of specialization and validate with historical evidence that it reflects absolute advantages in invention.

**Knowledge, Education, and Economic Growth: Evidence from the Enlightenment in France**

  <summary>Abstract</summary>  

  This paper advances and empirically establishes the hypothesis that economic growth depends on the interaction between two notions of productive knowledge: human capital---knowledge embodied in people---and non-rival ideas---codified knowledge. The analysis uses a unique historical setting in France in the Enlightenment to disentangle variation in both dimensions of productive knowledge and to identify their interaction. The empirical strategy exploits spatial variation in education which was predetermined for historical reasons and time variation of Enlightenment which made codified knowledge widely available. Using novel data on establishment and curriculum of all public secondary schools in France from 1500 to 1800, the analysis first establishes that the geography of schools and a scientific curriculum was determined by historical factors going back to late-Roman period, as well as religious competition during the sixteenth century. Then, the analysis shows that cities with scientific education exhibited a greater demand for codified productive knowledge during the Enlightenment, as measured by subscriptions to the newly available Encyclopedia. Reversely, the analysis also shows that the availability of codified knowledge increased the demand for scientific education, as reflected in enrolment in scientific subjects at schools of the revolutionary period. Finally, the analysis documents that education was instrumental for the adoption of codified knowledge as proxied by subsequent economic growth and innovation and patenting activity. The evidence is consistent with the view that human capital acquired in schools provided students with a "scientific literacy" necessary to utilize the ideas which spread during industrial enlightenment.
