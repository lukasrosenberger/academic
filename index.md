## About Me

I am a Ph.D. canditate in Economics at LMU Munich. My research spans economic growth, economic history, and innovation. 
In my dissertation, I investigate how human capital, idea growth, and idea diffusion interacted during Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution to originate Europe's richess.

During the academic year 2021--2022, I am visiting Northwestern University at invitation of Joel Mokyr. Previously, I have visited Brown University January to May 2020 at invitation of Oded Galor.

I am available for interviews during the virtual EEA meeting and the virtual ASSA/AEA meeting.

In my dissertation, I tackle the question "Why isn't the whole world developed?" from the perspective of Europe: How did Europe became developed in the first place? In context of France in the Enlightenment and Industrial Revolution, I establish novel facts which inform leading growth theories and big debates in economic history.

**Invention and Imitation during the Industrial Revolution** [[PDF](link)]

  &ensp;   with Carl Hallmann and Emre Enez Yavuz (Northwestern)


  &ensp; *Abstract:* What explains invention during the Industrial Revolution? In this paper, we test two leading but competing hypotheses from the economic history literature. We argue that the hypotheses are based on opposing economic forces which result in opposite predictions on the correlation of invention and imitation across industries in a two country setting---a specialization force leading to a negative correlation of invention and imitation, and a simultaneity force leading to a positive correlation. Using a data set on patents in France from 1791 to 1855 in which we can distinguish invention and imitation, we first document robust evidence on a pattern of comparative advantage in invention across French industries relative to British industries, consistent with the presence of the specialization force. We then present robust evidence for a strongly positive correlation of invention and imitation, supporting the conclusion that the simultaneity force is dominating as explanation of invention.

  This paper advances and empirically establishes the hypothesis that economic growth depends on the interaction between two notions of productive knowledge: human capital---knowledge embodied in people---and non-rival ideas---codified knowledge. The analysis uses a unique historical setting in France in the Enlightenment to disentangle variation in both dimensions of productive knowledge and to identify their interaction. The empirical strategy exploits spatial variation in education which was predetermined for historical reasons and time variation of Enlightenment which made codified knowledge widely available. Using novel data on establishment and curriculum of all public secondary schools in France from 1500 to 1800, the analysis first establishes that the geography of schools and a scientific curriculum was determined by historical factors going back to late-Roman period, as well as religious competition during the sixteenth century. Then, the analysis shows that cities with scientific education exhibited a greater demand for codified productive knowledge during the Enlightenment, as measured by subscriptions to the newly available Encyclopedia. Reversely, the analysis also shows that the availability of codified knowledge increased the demand for scientific education, as reflected in enrolment in scientific subjects at schools of the revolutionary period. Finally, the analysis documents that education was instrumental for the adoption of codified knowledge as proxied by subsequent economic growth and innovation and patenting activity. The evidence is consistent with the view that human capital acquired in schools provided students with a "scientific literacy" necessary to utilize the ideas which spread during industrial enlightenment.
